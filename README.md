# Usage
To use this tool you'll need an account on RetroAchievements. On the first start, you'll be prompted to 
enter your username and your API key, which you can find here: http://retroachievements.org/APIDemo.php

Currently, this tool is small and probably only useful to a minority of people, but I plan to extend it
even more in the future so more people can make use of it.
